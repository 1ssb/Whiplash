Our second paper which analyses the Whiplash Gradient Descent for Convex functions has been chosen for the Asian Journal of Control and to be presented at the 13th Asian Control Conference, Jeju Island, Korea. The link to our work is: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02140. In this paper we propose a variation on the Landau notation based complexity theory to prove using numerical computation the convergence rates in continuous time without resorting to rigorous Lyapunov functional analysis.
