Our second paper which analyses the Whiplash Gradient Descent for Convex functions has been published in the Asian Journal of Control and was presented at the 13th Asian Control Conference, Jeju Island, Korea. The link to our work is https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02140. In this paper, we propose a variation on the Landau notation-based complexity theory to prove using numerical computation the convergence rates in continuous time without resorting to rigorous Lyapunov functional analysis. Note the Whiplash Exploration Algorithm has been fully described rigorously in the final paper and I will not be releasing the MATLAB code for it as it seems unnecessary.
